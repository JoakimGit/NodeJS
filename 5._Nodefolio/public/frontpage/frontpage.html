            <p>Hello there, my name is Joakim and thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio.
            This project is a personal portfolio for the second mandatory assignment in the Node.js course.</p>
            <p>I am 27 years old and I am currently studying at KEA as the 4th semester.
            Besides for doing all of my homework on time, I also enjoy playing Path of Exile, and more recently, playing online chess.
            I used to also work out four times a week, but since the gyms closed down, I've been a bit of a slob, although I still try to get at least 1 small workout done.</p>
            <p>I used to study japanese at Copenhagen University and even spent one semester abroad living in Japan. Towards the end of that degree, I took an elective in programming (python)
            and ended up liking it so much it convinced me to change studies, and thus I enrolled at KEA.
